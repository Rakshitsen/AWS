**access.log:**  
This log keeps a record of every request that comes to the NGINX server:

- Where it came from (IP address)  
- When it came (timestamp)  
- What was requested (GET/POST, URL)  
- What was returned (status code like 200/404/500, etc.)  
- How long it took (response time)
192.168.1.1 - - [14/Apr/2025:11:03:21 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024


error.log:
this show server errors:

File not found

Permission denied

Server crash

Syntax error in config

[error] 1234#0: *1 open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/contact.html" failed (2: No such file or directory)



Where are these logs located?
Mostly, you'll find them at:

access.log = /var/log/nginx/access.log

error.log = /var/log/nginx/error.log

If you’ve provided a custom directory like /nginx/access-log, then that was likely part of the CloudWatch configuration — the log path was customized specifically for log collection purposes.




**3. How will these logs be useful in the future?**

**Scenario 1: Website is slow**  
Check `access.log` — is some IP spamming the server?  
Is there too much load on a particular page?

**Scenario 2: User says "Page not working"**  
Look into `error.log` — is a file missing?  
Could it be a permission issue?

**Scenario 3: Scaling test**  
A sudden spike in traffic visible in `access.log`?  
A CloudWatch alarm might be about to trigger.

**Scenario 4: Suspected hacker attack**  
Are there repeated suspicious requests?  
You can trace the IP in `access.log`.  
404 spam or brute force attempts might also be visible.




Examples:


10.0.201.253 - - [13/Apr/2025:21:18:52 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 28043 "-" "ELB-HealthChecker/2.0" "-"


IP: 10.0.201.253 → internal IP (probably from your Application Load Balancer)

Date/Time: 13 April 2025, 21:18:52

Request: GET / → homepage access

Status code: 200 → OK

Bytes served: 28043

User-Agent: "ELB-HealthChecker/2.0" → This request was made by ALB ka health check, not a human.

Conclusion:
ALB regular check karta hai ki tumhara EC2 “zinda” hai ya nahi. Agar yeh health check fail ho gaya toh ALB tumhare EC2 ko target group se hata dega.







10.0.10.43 - - [13/Apr/2025:21:18:55 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 28043 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)... Edg/90.0.818.46" "154.81.156.54"


Iska matlab:
IP: 10.0.10.43 → This might be ALB’s internal IP again

User-Agent: "Mozilla/5.0 ... Edg/90.0.818.46" → This is a real browser (Edge) used by a human

Client IP: "154.81.156.54" → That’s the actual public IP of the person who opened your site

Conclusion:
Yeh log human ne generate kiya, real browser se, maybe tum ya koi aur.
